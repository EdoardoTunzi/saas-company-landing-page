## 🚀 Introduction

This is a responsive, clean landing page built for an AI SaaS product.  
I developed it using React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Zustand and Vite to ensure fast performance, easy maintainability, and a modern UI/UX.

The page is designed to convert visitors into users through effective design, smooth animations, and a clear value proposition.

I built this project starting from an online tutorial, then customized and expanded it to sharpen my skills with Tailwind and TypeScript.
This page is for demonstration purposes only. The company name and content are fictional.
